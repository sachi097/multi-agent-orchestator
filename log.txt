                        User input: Evaluate A carnival snack booth made $50 selling popcorn each day. It made three times as much selling cotton candy. For a 5-day activity, the booth has to pay $30 rent and $75 for the cost of the ingredients. How much did the booth earn for 5 days after paying the rent and the cost of ingredients?
                        Agent response: ["First, let's calculate the booth's earnings from selling popcorn and cotton candy. \n\n1. **Daily Earnings on Popcorn**: $50 per day. \n   For 5 days: \n   5 days x $50/day = $250 from popcorn.\n\n2. **Daily Earnings on Cotton Candy**: Three times as much as popcorn. \n   Daily cotton candy earnings: $50 x 3 = $150 per day. \n   For 5 days: \n   5 days x $150/day = $750 from cotton candy.\n\n3. **Total Earnings for 5 Days**: \n   Total earnings = $250 (popcorn) + $750 (cotton candy) = $1000.\n\n4. **Costs**: \n   - Rent: $30 \n   - Ingredients: $75 \n   Total costs = $30 + $75 = $105.\n\n5. **Net Earnings after Costs**: \n   Net earnings = Total earnings - Total costs = $1000 - $105 = $895.\n\nThus, the booth earned $895 for 5 days after paying the rent and the cost of ingredients."]

                        Agent response: ['To find the total number of blueberries that Miss Darlington has, we need to calculate the number of blueberries in all the baskets she has collected. She already has 1 basket containing 20 blueberries. She then picks 9 additional baskets, each containing the same amount of blueberries (20). Therefore, the calculation is as follows:\n\n1. Total baskets = 1 (initial basket) + 9 (additional baskets) = 10 baskets.\n2. Total blueberries = Total baskets × Blueberries per basket = 10 × 20 = 200 blueberries.\n\nThus, Miss Darlington has a total of 200 blueberries.']
